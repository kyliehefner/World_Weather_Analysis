# World Weather Analysis
## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to create an application that will plan a trip for the customer given their desired weather for the trip. The application gathers weather data on hundreds of cities using the open weather map api, and filters the cities based on the customer's preferred weather. Then it uses a google api to retrieve hotel data for each city. When the customer has chosen four cities for their trip, the application again uses a google api to create a travel route and map between the cities.
